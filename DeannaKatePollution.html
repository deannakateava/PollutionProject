          <p style="margin-left: 50px;">Pollution is a big issue that affects over 100 million people, which is comparable to the impact of many well known diseases, including malaria and HIV. The effects of air pollution can vary greatly for humans. Some short-term side effects can include irritation to the nose, throat, eyes, or skin, headaches, dizziness, and nausea. However, some more serious long-term effects can last anywhere from years to a lifetime. These include heart disease, lung cancer, respiratory diseases, and damage to different organs such as the brain, kidneys, and livers. For people living in places with high levels of air pollutants, there is a 20% higher risk of dying from lung cancer. It's not just adults who are impacted by pollution, more than 3 million children under 5 years old die from environmental factors and over 40% of the global burden of disease falls on them. There is some suspicion that some air pollutants can cause birth defects as well. Not only can pollution create new problems for people, but they can worsen many conditions like asthma, heart disease, and lung disease. Although the effects can be different for each person, younger children and older adults are more susceptible to these effects. For example, pollution is shown to cause an increased risk of heart attack on the elderly, which you can learn more about

          <p>Although pollution can have a huge impact on our lives, this issue doesn't just affect the human population. Pollution kills off over a million seabirds and 100,000 sea mammals each year. These wildlife are affected by many of the toxic pollutants that we use. For example, oil can cause oil spills that have a huge impact on our aquatic wildlife. These oil spills can instantly cause a large death toll for our marine life and if heavy oils get onto sea otters or the feathers of birds, they can lose the ability to keep themselves warm, which would result in hypothermia. Although light oils, which are fuel oils like gasoline, are very volatile and don’t in the marine environment too long, they can ignite or explode and are still considered to be toxic, since they are dangerous to plants and animals that they touch and can even be dangerous to humans who breathe it in or get it on their skin. Also, the plastic from the oceans has a huge impact on marine life. Many marine animals like sea turtles, whales, and seabirds mistake plastic and other marine debris for a potential food source and accidentally consume them and other marine life like seals and sealions not only become entangled in fishing nets, lines, and lures, but they also become entangled in plastic bags or plastic packing bands, which wan lead to injury and death.

          <p style="margin-left: 50px;">There are many solutions to this issue and there are many things that you could do to help. For example, having cleanups can help save many animals’ lives and discourage people from littering in the future. You can start hosting an event by going to the <a href="https://www.dosomething.org/us/campaigns/abc-cleanup?source=facts/11-facts-about-pollution" style="color: #91AED9">ABC Cleanup website</a>. Another way we can help improve our situation would be reducing the amount of nonrenewable resources that are used. Although Americans only make up 5% of the world’s population, 25% of the resources used worldwide are used by the US. The US burns up nearly 25% of the coal, 26% of the oil, and 27% of the world’s natural gas. If we can figure out a way to decrease this percentage, the amount of air pollution we have in the world would be greatly reduced. We could also help improve our environment in general by recycling and composting. Recycling and composting prevented 85 million tons of material away from being disposed of in 2010, up from 18 million tons in 1980, so continuing to do so would be beneficial for the world that we live in.In addition, because of the carbon dioxide that vehicles emit, it would be better to take public transportation or ride a bike instead of driving a car, if possible. Some more simple things you can do are avoiding aerosol cans, recycling yard trimmings instead of burning them, and not smoking cigarettes. There are so many more things that you could do to improve this issue and our environment and if you want to learn more about that, you should do your own research or refer to some of the articles in the related articles section to learn more about this issue and solutions that you can take part in to resolve this issue!
